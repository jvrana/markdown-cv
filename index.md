## Software Projects

`2019-present`
[Terrarium](https://github.com/jvrana/Terrarium)<br>
Terrarium is a dynamic computer-aided process planner ([CAPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_process_planning))
for biology designed for agile manufacturing of biological products, such as E Coli & Yeast strains, or Mammalian cell
lines. The software automatically plans scientific experiments in Aquarium using historical planning data and current
laboratory inventory and solves an MST optimization problem to give optimal and valid operational workflows.

`2017-present`
[DASi Automated DNA Assembly](https://github.com/jvrana/DASi-DNA-Design)<br>
DASi is an automatic DNA cloning plan designer aimed for operating on small budgets by
focusing on material re-use and a dead-simple user interface. The software converts a nucleotide sequence,
or a library of sequences, to an executable molecular assembly plan while optimizing material cost, assembly
efficiency, and assembly time. No molecular biology expertise is required to use DASi.
DASi produced plans can be automatically executed using a biofabrication facility
(such as the [UW-BIOFAB](http://www.uwbiofab.org/).

`2016-present`
[Aquarium](https://www.aquarium.bio/)/[Trident](https://github.com/klavinslab/trident)<br>
Aquarium, a open-source human-in-the-loop laboratory automation system that enables rapid,
flexible, and reproducible workflow development and execution. Trident (developed by Justin Vrana),
is the fully-featured Python interface for Aquarium that allows high-throughput scripted experiment
submission, fast data mining, and LIMS browsing.

### Mini Projects

[BenchlingAPI](https://github.com/klavinslab/benchling-api) The unofficial Python API for Benchling.

[jdna](https://jvrana.github.io/jdna/index.html) A Python DNA sequence editor that represents sequences as a linked
list. It includes basic molecular reaction simulations and a viewer class.

[pyblast-bio](https://github.com/jvrana/pyblast) Python wrapper for installing and using NCBI's BLAST algorithms.

[keats](https://github.com/jvrana/keats) Keats is an Python build, installation, and workflow manager.
